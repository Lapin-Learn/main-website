However, I did detect some issues with word stress and intonation that occasionally affected clarity. For example, there was some unclear pronunciation of \"city\". Working on these aspects will make your speech easier to understand. Additionally, practicing vowel and consonant sounds that you find challenging can enhance your overall pronunciation."

You used vocabulary relevant to the topic of your hometown, such as \"biggest city,\" \"crowded,\" \"big population,\" \"high buildings,\" and \"entertainment centers.\" However, your range was somewhat limited, and there were instances of repetition. To improve, I encourage you to expand your vocabulary and use more varied expressions. Paraphrasing instead of repeating the same phrases can also boost your score."

However, to improve, I recommend working on reducing pauses and using a wider range of discourse markers to connect your ideas more smoothly."

While many were accurate, I noticed a few errors, such as subject-verb agreement (e.g., \"This is the biggest city\") and articles (e.g., \"the city for\" should be \"a city famous for\"). To enhance your score, I suggest focusing on accuracy, particularly in complex sentence structures."
