            <p className="mb-4 indent-6">
              In 2016, the British professional tennis player Andy Murray was ranked as the world's
              number one. It was an incredible achievement by any standard - made even more
              remarkable by the fact that he did this during a period considered to be one of the
              strongest in the sport's history, competing against the likes of Rafael Nadal, Roger
              Federer and Novak Djokovic, to name just a few. Yet five years previously, he had been
              regarded as a talented outsider who entered but never won the major tournaments.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 indent-6">
              Of the changes that account for this transformation, one was visible and widely
              publicised: in 2011, Murray invited former number one player Ivan Lendl onto his
              coaching team - a valuable addition that had a visible impact on the player's playing
              style. Another change was so subtle as to pass more or less unnoticed. Like many
              players, Murray has long preferred a racket that consists of two types of string: one
              for the mains (verticals) and another for the crosses (horizontals). While he
              continued to use natural string in the crosses, in 2012 he switched to a synthetic
              string for the mains. A small change, perhaps, but its importance should not be
              underestimated.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 indent-6">
              The modification that Murray made is just one of a number of options available to
              players looking to tweak their rackets in order to improve their games. "Touring
              professionals have their rackets customised to their specific needs,' says Colin
              Triplow, a UK-based professional racket stringer. 'It's a highly important part of
              performance maximisation.' Consequently, the specific rackets used by the world's
              elite are not actually readily available to the public; rather, each racket is
              individually made to suit the player who uses it. Take the US professional tennis
              players Mike and Bob Bryan, for example: 'We're very particular with our racket
              specifications,' they say. 'All our rackets are sent from our manufacturer to Tampa,
              Florida, where our frames go through a ... thorough customisation process.' They
              explain how they have adjusted not only racket length, but even experimented with
              different kinds of paint. The rackets they use now weigh more than the average model
              and also have a denser string pattern (i.e. more crosses and mains).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 indent-6">
              The primary reason for these modifications is simple: as the line between winning and
              losing becomes thinner and thinner, even these slight changes become more and more
              important. As a result, players and their teams are becoming increasingly creative
              with the modifications to their rackets as they look to maximise their competitive
              advantage.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 indent-6">
              Racket modifications mainly date back to the 1970s, when the amateur German tennis
              player Werner Fischer started playing with the so-called spaghetti-strung racket. It
              created a string bed that generated so much topspin that it was quickly banned by the
              International Tennis Federation. However, within a decade or two, racket modification
              became a regularity. Today it is, in many ways, an aspect of the game that is equal in
              significance to nutrition or training.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 indent-6">
              Modifications can be divided into two categories: those to the string bed and those to
              the racket frame. The former is far more common than the latter: the choice of the
              strings and the tension with which they are installed is something that nearly all
              professional players experiment with. They will continually change it depending on
              various factors including the court surface, climatic conditions, and game styles.
              Some will even change it depending on how they feel at the time.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 indent-6">
              At one time, all tennis rackets were strung with natural gut made from the outer layer
              of sheep or cow intestines. This all changed in the early 1990s with the development
              of synthetic strings that were cheaper and more durable. They are made from three
              materials: nylon (relatively durable and affordable), Kevlar (too stiff to be used
              alone) or co-polyester (polyester combined with additives that enhance its
              performance). Even so, many professional players continue to use a 'hybrid set-up',
              where a combination of both synthetic and natural strings are used.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 indent-6">
              Of the synthetics, co-polyester is by far the most widely used. It's a perfect fit for
              the style of tennis now played, where players tend to battle it out from the back of
              the court rather than coming to the net. Studies indicate that the average spin from a
              co-polyester string is 25% greater than that from natural string or other synthetics.
              In a sense, the development of co-polyester strings has revolutionised the game.
              However, many players go beyond these basic adjustments to the strings and make
              changes to the racket frame itself. For example, much of the serving power of US
              professional player Pete Sampras was attributed to the addition of four to five lead
              weights onto his rackets, and today many professionals have the weight adjusted during
              the manufacturing process.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 indent-6">
              Other changes to the frame involve the handle. Players have individual preferences for
              the shape of the handle and some will have the handle of one racket moulded onto the
              frame of a different racket. Other players make different changes. The professional
              Portuguese player Gonçalo Oliveira replaced the original grips of his rackets with
              something thinner because they had previously felt uncomfortable to hold.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 indent-6">
              Racket customisation and modification have pushed the standards of the game to greater
              levels that few could have anticipated in the days of natural strings and heavy,
              wooden frames, and it's exciting to see what further developments there will be in the
              future.
